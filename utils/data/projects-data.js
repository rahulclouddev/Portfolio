      "I built a full-stack restaurant and food discovery platform, inspired by Zomato and Swiggy. Users can search food items, explore restaurants, and read reviews. I developed the backend with Node.js and Express, managing data using MongoDB. Vendor login, restaurant management, and dynamic dish listings were implemented using JWT authentication. The frontend is designed in React with Tailwind CSS, and integrates Google Maps for regional search. The app is optimized for responsiveness and vendor scalability.",
